Tokens are at the core of your visual language. They define the colors, type
sizes, spacing and overall layout parameters of your design.

und-css let’s you configure your visual language using SASS variables and
transforms your tokens into CSS custom properties, you can access them in your
own stylesheets without depending on a preprocessor.

Tokens serve as modifiers for [objects](/objects) and can also be turned into [utility styles](/utilities).

As already said und-css serves as a meta-framework. So you have full flexiblity
over the configuration, with as little conventions imposed as possible.
Just need one color? No problem! Have 1.000 of spacing modifier – sure, whatever makes you happy.

The following documents how you can set your tokens.
