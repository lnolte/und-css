The auto grid provides a simple way of creating a responsive grid without
writing media queries or relying on breakpoints. This is good if you just have a
bunch of equally important elements you need to put in a grid.

{% codeSample %}
<div class="o-auto-grid">
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
</div>
{% endcodeSample %}

## Spacing Modifier
You can set the gridâ€™s gutter by using one of the spacing modifiers
provided in your `_settings.scss`. Modifiers are passed as the `data-spacing`
attribute.

{% codeSample %}
<div
  class="o-auto-grid"
  data-spacing="large"
>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
</div>
{% endcodeSample %}

## Measure Modifier
The auto grid is sized intrinsically. That means that instead of specifying the
amount of columns you want to have, you specify the minimum width each column
should occupy. CSS grid will then calculate the neccessary amount of columns and
rows to lay out your items.

The min-width is expressed in measures. You can set the min-width by using one
of the measure values set in `_settings.scss`. Measure modifiers are passed as
the `data-measure` attribute.

{% codeSample %}
<div
  class="o-auto-grid"
  data-measure="narrow"
>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
</div>
{% endcodeSample %}

{% codeSample %}
<div
  class="o-auto-grid"
  data-measure="wide"
>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
    <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
      I am in a box
    </div>
</div>
{% endcodeSample %}

## Stretching the Grid
By default every element in the grid will obey strictly to the grid. If you only
have one box in a grid at a large viewport, this box will only occupy the first
column, even if there are potentially more columns available. In many scenarios
this is the desired default.

However you might also need a grid from time to time where the elements stretch
out to always fill the full width of a row. This can be achieved by adding the
`data-stretch` modifier to your auto grid element.

If a grid row is wider than the amount of available columns it will break into a
new row thereby reverting to the default auto grid behavior.

There is a good [in-depth article on CSS Grid column
sizing](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/)
over on CSS-Tricks.

{% codeSample %}
<div
  class="o-auto-grid"
  data-measure="narrow"
  data-stretch
>
  <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
    I am in a box
  </div>
  <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
    I am in a box
  </div>
  <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
    I am in a box
  </div>
  <div class="o-box u-bg-white">
    I am in a box
  </div>
</div>
{% endcodeSample %}

## Use Cases
The auto grid is good when you have a bunch of equally important items that you
want to place in a responsive grid without worrying about breakpoints.

A prime example is a collection of cards (e.g. news teaser of team members) that
need to be layed out automatically.

**Do not use auto-grid** if you need granular control over the grid. In those
cases you should use the manual [grid object](/objects/grid/).
