Objects are here to make your life easier. They solve common CSS headaches like
centering things or responsive grids so you can focus more on creating unique
visual languages instead of wrestling with CSS.

Please note: The given compatibility charts assume that custom properties and
CSS calculation are available in any browser â€“ either natively or because you
used a polyfill or transformation in your build step. See the [introduction on
cross browser compatibility](/#cross-browser-compatibility) for more
information.
