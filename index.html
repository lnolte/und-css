        <main class="c-page__text"><h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>For a quick start you first need to install und-css as a dependency to your
project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn add -D und-css # or npm
</code></pre>
<p>Presuming you have some kind of SASS transpiler running in your project (e.g.
via webpack or some other task runner) you then simple required the und-css
entry file in your SASS stylesheet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">@import './node_modules/und-css/src/styles';
</code></pre>
<h2>Important Globals</h2>
<p>To make live easier and more predictable und-css makes some assumptions about
your HTML markup and sets some opionated styling defaults.</p>
<h3>HTML5 Doctype</h3>
<p>und-css requires the HTML5 Doctype. Without it you might experience some weird
rendering issues.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Responsive Meta Tag</h3>
<p>und-css provides responsive utility classes to make designing for <em>different
viewports</em> easier. To ensure proper renderung and zooming for all devices, you
need to <strong>add the responsive view meta tag</strong> to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Box-sizing</h3>
<p>For more logical spacing and size calculations in CSS, und-css switches the
global <code>box-sizing</code> value from <code>content-box</code> to <code>border-box</code>.</p>
<p>On rare occasions you therefore might want to reset this in your custom
component styles building on und-css.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.c-my-component {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
</code></pre>

        <h1 class="u-text-lg u-mb-large">What is und-css</h1>
        <main class="c-page__text"><h2>Meta-Framework</h2>
<p>und-css isn’t a CSS framework in the original definition. That is, it doesn’t
come with any styling. und-css is meant to provide a solid baseline for your
custom CSS styles by being almost fully customizable allowing you to freely
configure design tokens and creating as many (or as little) utility classes as
you like. und-css is here to speed up your process, not to make all your
websites look the same.</p>
<h2>Parts</h2>
<p>und-css consists of three parts: Tokens, Objects and Utilities. These serve as
the foundation for further styling that can be built on top of it (by writing
custom components) or with it (by generating a lot of utility classes).</p>
<h3>Tokens</h3>
<p>The formalization of visual language (read »design system«) is at the heart of
the und-css approach. At its core und-css is a config file (<code>_settings.scss</code>)
containing all neccessary information about the visual language of the site or
app you’re building, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typography
<ul>
<li>Sizes</li>
<li>Font Families</li>
<li>Leading</li>
<li>Tracking</li>
<li>Measures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Layout Values
<ul>
<li>Spacing</li>
<li>Widths</li>
<li>Dimensions</li>
<li>Breakpoints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>und-css takes all the information provided in the config and converts them to
CSS custom properties, so other parts of the stylesheet can easily access them.</p>
<p>The tokens generated by und-css are fully customizable in the config file.</p>
<h3>Objects</h3>
<p>Objects are meant to be time-savers by providing simple abstractions over common
layout challenges such as grids, boxes or centering things. Objects help you to
quickly create macro layouts. Parameters of objects can be altered using
modifiers, to make adjustments to your micro-layout.</p>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p>Utility classes, sometimes also called atomic or functional CSS, just do one
thing like setting a color, font-size or spacing (most of the time they will just set a single CSS property). und-css comes with a simple utility class generator that can be fully configured to suit your needs (and file size). By default only commonly used utility classes are provided.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>und-css was created as an internal tool to be used in personal and <a href="https://und-pohlen.de">und Pohlen</a> frontend projects. It is a structured approach to the way I write CSS—that is more from a graphic designer’s perspective and less from a developer’s perspective.</p>
<p>und-css combines my CSS experiences with the good parts of frameworks I’ve
worked with over the years. Honorable mentions include: InuitCSS, TailwindCSS
and Every Layout.</p>
<h3>Why SASS?</h3>
<p>The answer is quite pragmatic: Because it’s the Preprocessor I am most familiar
with. SASS isn’t my dream choice for this project, but given my experience with
it, it provided a quick and easy way to get a first version of this framework
done. In the future I plan to move the codebase to a more contemporary tooling like
PostCSS.</p>

        <h1 class="u-text-lg u-mb-large">Namespacing</h1>
        <main class="c-page__text"><h2>Why use namespaces</h2>
<p>When working at scale a lot of our time is spent reading existing code trying to
understand what it does. Naming conventions such as BEM help to clearly
distinguish parts of a component in relation to the other parts of a component.</p>
<p>Namespaces take this a step further by prefixing CSS classes according to their
function in the global sense. A namespace can help us to quickly understand what
a certain class does in absolute terms. They help to easily understand what
existing codes does and how it might be altered to achieve a desired change in
design. Namespaces greatly reduce the urge to create new selectors.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the motivation behind using namespaced CSS check
out <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/">Harry Roberts’ article on namespaced
CSS</a>.</p>
<h2>Default Namespaces</h2>
<p>By default und-css uses two different namespaces to distinguish the classes it
provides and generates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>o-</strong>: Signifies that a class belongs to an object. Objects may be used in
any number of non related contexts. Objects provide abstractions of common
layouts. They don’t come with any cosmetic styling.</li>
<li><strong>u-</strong>: Signifies a utility class. Utility classes have a very specific role
(mostly just providing one CSS rule). They are commonly used to provide quick
access to design tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you build your own layout objects or utility styles on top of und-css it is
recommended that you follow the same namespace convention.</p>
<h2>Recommended Namespaces</h2>
<p>As und-css only provides layout objects and utility classes it does not cover
how you handle and name your custom component styles. To distinguish your
components from objects and utilities it is recommended to introduce a new
namespace.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>c-</strong>: Should signify a component style in your custom CSS. A component is a
specific implementation of UI. Changes made to a component style only affect
instances of this component but nothing else in your design.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing / Removing Namespaces</h2>
<p>und-css default namespaces are a suggestion rather than a convention. You can
ovveride them in your <code>_settings.scss</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$utilities--prefix</code>: Sets the prefix of your utility classes. Defaults to
<code>u-</code>, set to an empty String if you don’t want a prefix.</li>
<li><code>$objects--prefix</code>: Sets the prefix of object classes. Default to <code>o-</code>, set to
an ampty String if you don’t want any prefix.</li>
</ul>
